# Create a file ".budgetrc" in your home directory.
# Then copy-paste this file (or whatever you need)
# Lines with a '#' are comments and won't be read
# Keep in mind, empty values like "default_currency=" will be valid (so in this case your currency is a currency without code/name :D)

# VERY IMPORTANT --> Don't put comments on the right side of the '=' sign as they will be read as values.
